    "text": "The technology of monitoring and prediction is based on the law of seismic entropy production (Akopian, 2013, PDF). This law is viewed only within the framework of new seismic parameters calculated on the basis of the most reliable and transparent information – earthquake catalogs. It allows to build a mathematical pattern of the geological environment (SS volume), due to which, for the first time in world practice, it becomes possible to visualize the entire process of preparing a strong earthquake. \nThe method of seismic entropy does not contradict everything that has been accumulated and developed by specialists in the field of earthquake forecasting and seismic risk reduction, on the contrary, it allows us to combine these efforts and significantly increase their effectiveness, increasing society's resilience to natural disasters, as well as from the point of view of effective allocation of finances and targeted preparation for strong earthquakes. \nDue to its versatility, the method already makes it possible to create a multi-level (global, regional, national and local) automated information system for seismic monitoring. Moreover, for well-defined seismic systems (for example, Italy, Japan, California), a reliable short-term forecast can be made. \nWe believe that the seismic entropy method, by its universality, transparency, reliability and high efficiency, is just the tool on the basis of which seismologists and governments from around the world can already combine their efforts to develop common international norms and rules for forecasting, warning and taking measures in case of seismic danger."

So, it is possible to regularly inform a people about the seismic situation in any region of the world, at the same time to report where it is potentially dangerous and where it is safe."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the accuracy of forecast?",
        "answer": "- The accuracy of the forecast depends on the reliability of the SS and the hierarchy of the identified subsystems. Today, in SS the forecast accuracy from 1 to 6 months, the magnitude of ± 0.1, is limited in place by the size of the system and the order of the size of the source. The accuracy of the negative forecast (when destructive earthquakes are excluded, and other forecasts are refuted) is very high."
      },
      {
        "question": "It is possible to predict earthquakes in the short term? ",
        "answer": "- Yes, in some cases this can be done today, depending on the nature of training. On average, every fifth earthquake can be predicted in the short term (from 1 to 7 days). This could be done, for example, for the earthquake of March 11, 2011 (Tohoku) in Japan."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of technology over others?",
        "answer": "- Because it is theoretically justified, universal, effective, transparent, and reliable, does not require large costs, because it is based on existing and renewable catalogs of earthquakes. It allows to visualize the process of preparing strong earthquakes, to control both the land and the ocean floor, practically tested on almost all seismically dangerous regions of the world. For all these indicators and the forecast accuracy, it has no analogue in the world."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can forecasts be used to save lives and reduce the risk of damage?",
        "answer": "- The technology makes it possible to take a few preparatory measures before the expected catastrophe in the long, medium, and short term, as well as immediately after the catastrophe. These measures are developed based on the characteristics of the technology, considering the specifics of the expected earthquake and possible tsunami, as well as considering the level of development of the country prone to natural disaster. Technology allows effective development of parametric earthquake insurance."
